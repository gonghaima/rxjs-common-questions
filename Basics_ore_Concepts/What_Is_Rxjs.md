# What is RxJS?

**RxJS** is a JavaScript library for reactive programming using observables. It helps manage asynchronous data streams such as events, HTTP requests, and user input in a clean, declarative way.

**Why is it used in Angular?**
RxJS is used in Angular to handle async operations (like HTTP requests, user input, and events) in a reactive, composable way. It simplifies complex data flows and state management across Angular apps.

**Key Points:**
- Enables reactive programming in JavaScript
- Makes handling async data (events, HTTP, etc.) easier
- Widely used in Angular (HttpClient, Forms, EventEmitter)

**Example Use Cases:**
- Real-time search suggestions
- Handling user input streams
- Managing API responses
